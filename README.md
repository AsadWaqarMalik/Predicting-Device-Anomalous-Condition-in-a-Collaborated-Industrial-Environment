Predicting Device Anomalous Condition in a Collaborated Industrial Environment
The industrial environment augments resource-constrained devices to bring services closer to autonomous devices. However, over time, these devices get overburdened due to computational workload which results in degraded network performance. Therefore, the devices are programmed to share resources with nearby devices. However, due to real-time collaboration, there is the possibility that the device moves to an undefined state and starts behaving maliciously. This can impact the entire collaborative environment laid to meet the industrial products deadline. The existing work is mainly focused on task offloading in the industrial internet of things; however, such scenarios are not relatively unexplored. In this work, we proposed an industrial simulation framework that enables the resource-sharing environment and also identifies the undefined device behavior. Further, our detection scheme is based on an intelligent model trained on device behavior through the machine-in-a-loop mechanism and deployed at network intersections i.e. edge nodes.
